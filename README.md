# OpenPDAC

OpenPDAC is an offline Eulerian-Lagrangian model for the simulation of volcanic flows. The model solves the conservation equations of mass, momentum and energy for a compressible multiphase gas/fine particles mixture and the lagrangian transport equations for larger particles. The solver is based on the OpenFOAM C++ toolbox for computational fluid dynamics.
